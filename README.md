# My Portfolio website

#####Hi! This repo here contains all the files of my **Portfolio  Website**.

This is the version 3 of my website, that means there were two versions before it, but after learning more about __Web Development and Web Designing__, I made a final minmalistic version. That contains as minimum distractions and animations but at the same time provides much better look and feel.

##EDIT

#####As of June 14, I have taken down the website from github pages and moved the website to **Heroku app** server as I made the website a __Full Stack Website__, Using **NodeJS**.


#####some little info the website and its components
* The website now shows inspirational quotes at the bottom rather Dio meme joke, as you refresh the website the quote changes.
* The Favicon of this website is the pixel art of a character "wither" from minecraft.
* The image for the bookshelf is also from minecraft.
