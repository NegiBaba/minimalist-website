# minimalist-website

A minimalist version of my portfolio, this website is front end only using html, css, js and bootstrap for responsiveness.

*interesting thing about favicon and third project img*
The favicon is a game character "wither" from minecraft and the bookshelf design is also from minecraft(my favourite game).
